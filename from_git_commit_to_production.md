# COMMIT-TO-PRODUCTION PROCESS

## THE GOAL: 
ENABLE, ENCOURAGE AND EMPOWER SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO MAKE SMALL, INCREMENTAL, CHANGES AND RELEASE THOSE CHANGES TO PRODUCTION FREQUENTLY.
THE DEVELOPERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR RELEASING TO PRODUCTION

## BENEFITS:
- FASTER TIME TO MARKET
- Demonstrate faster customer value delivery
- FASTER FEEDBACK LOOPS
- Satisfy the customer through early and Continuous Delivery of valuable software

## SAFETY MECHANISMS
- FEATURE FLAGS - Runtime toggling and gradual rollout capability
- FAST ROLLBACKS - Automated triggers with <30 second recovery
- COMPREHENSIVE MONITORING - Real-time health checks and business metrics
- CANARY DEPLOYMENTS - Risk mitigation through gradual traffic shifting
- AUTOMATED TESTING - Multi-layer validation before production
- IMMUTABLE DEPLOYMENTS - No in-place updates, always deploy new versions

---

## >> ENCOURAGING SMALL CHANGES <<
- **Batch size limits** - PRs over X lines require architectural review
- **Deployment metrics** - track and celebrate small, frequent deployments
- **Time-boxed features** - break epics into daily-deployable increments
- **Pair programming** - knowledge sharing reduces fear of deployment
- **Deployment frequency targets** - Aim for 5+ deployments per day per team
- **Lead time tracking** - Measure and improve commit-to-production time
- **Celebration culture** - Recognize teams with high deployment frequency

---

## >> SOFTWARE DEVELOPER WORKFLOW <<

### 1. Dev make small, incremental changes, in a feature-branch
### 2. The changes are behind feature flags. The flag is set "false" by default.
### 3. Dev run pre-commit tasks on their local machines	
- **Local Builds**
- **Local Testing**: Developers run unit tests, enforced by a pre-commit hook
- **Linting**: enforced by a pre-commit hook
- **Security scanning**: Local SAST tools integration
- **Dependency checking**: Vulnerability scanning of dependencies

### 4. [Optional, but recommended] Ephemeral environment for feature-branch testing 

Create a Feature Branch and give it a name of the format: "deploy/<a-descriptive-comment>"
- Eg: `git checkout -b deploy/feature-xyz`

Push the feature branch to remote

Github will detect the new branch, matching regex - "name starts with deploy/", and will trigger a webhook to invoke a Jenkins pipeline.

**The pipeline will:**
- identifies that the author/owner has invoked the job
- lint code
- build code
- build container image
- scan container image (Trivy, Aqua, or equivalent)
- create/update helm chart
- push container image to repo
- push helm chart to repo
- ensure test namespace is prepped
- deploy the helm charts (built in CI) (application + monitoring + db_jobs (if_required)) to test namespace
- send a slack/teams message with the links to load-balancer/apps
- **Configure feature flags** for testing environment
- **Set up monitoring dashboards** specific to the feature

**Namespace Management:**
- The namespace will live for 3 hrs by default
- Option to extend timeout period when creating the job
- Label added with expiration time: `expiration: "2024-01-15T15:30:00Z"`
- Automated cleanup job runs every 30 minutes to delete expired namespaces
- **Resource quotas** applied to prevent resource exhaustion
- **Network policies** for security isolation

### 5. Once Dev has used the ephemeral env to test his changes, he creates a PR

### 6. Upon the creation of a PR, Git webhook runs the following Pipeline in PARALLEL

**DEVSECOPS pipeline Triggered in parallel:**

**Continuous Integration:**
- lint
- build
- unit test
- **Code coverage analysis** (minimum 80% coverage required)
- Sonarqube (SCA and SAST)
- **OWASP dependency check**
- **License compliance scanning**
- Trivy for helm chart analysis
- **Configuration validation** (Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts)

**Continuous Delivery:**
- build container image
- scan container image (CVE scanning, malware detection)
- create/update helm chart
- **Helm chart security scanning** (Polaris, Falco rules)
- push container image to repo
- push helm chart to repo
- ensure test namespace is prepped
- deploy the helm charts (built in CI) to test namespace
- **Database migration validation** (if applicable)
- run integration, smoke, acceptance and e-2-e tests
- **Performance testing** (load testing, response time validation)
- **Security testing** (DAST, API security scanning)
- tear down the env, or uninstall helm chart so that the env is ready for next deployment

### 7. The PR cannot be peer-reviewed until the CI/CD builds pass.

### 8. The PR is approved by a peer.
**Peer Review Requirements:**
- **Security review** for code touching sensitive areas
- **Architecture review** for significant changes
- **Database review** for schema changes
- **Two-person approval** for production configuration changes

### 9. The PR is merged into Trunk.

### 10. The same CI/CD pipelines are again triggered on the merge to Trunk.

**IT'S THE DEV'S RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE CI/CD BUILDS ON TRUNK WORK**

**IMPORTANT: Trunk Stability Rules**
**If the CI/CD fails on Trunk, no other merges are allowed until it's fixed.**

**Fix or revert build failures within 10 minutes (time-boxing)**
- **Never Go Home on a Broken Build**
  - Check in regularly and early enough to deal with problems
  - Don't check in less than 1 hour before end of work
  - If uncertain, save check-in for next morning
  - If all else fails, revert your change and keep in local working copy
- **If a teammate breaks the rules, revert their changes**
- **Don't Comment Out Failing Tests**
- **Take Responsibility for All Breakages That Result from Your Changes**
- **If it's unclear who committed a failure, it's everyone's responsibility who may have contributed**

---

## >> DEPLOYING TO PRODUCTION <<

Once a change has been merged into trunk and the CI/CD are successful, it's now the developer's responsibility to push that change into Production

**Follow ETSY's process to get the change into production:**

### 1. Dev enters a Teams/Slack channel - #deployment-requests
### 2. Types: @DeployBot request deployment for commit {sha}
### 3. Receives deployment token: DEP-{timestamp}
### 4. Waits for token to be called in deployment queue
### 5. When ready, executes Progressive-Delivery Jenkins pipeline with token

### 6. The Jenkins pipeline's stages:

**Commit Eligibility Verification:**
- ✅ Commit exists in approved branches (main/develop/release)
- ✅ All CI stages passed (build, security scan, unit tests)
- ✅ All CD stages passed (integration tests, deployment verification)
- ✅ Valid deployment token provided
- ✅ No blocking issues in tracking systems
- ✅ **Change approval workflow completed** (for regulated changes)
- ✅ **Security clearance obtained** (for security-sensitive changes)

**Test Validation:**
- ✅ Unit Tests: Code-level functionality verification
- ✅ Integration Tests: Service interaction validation
- ✅ Security Scan: Vulnerability and compliance checks
- ✅ Regression Tests: Existing functionality preservation
- ✅ End-to-End Tests: Complete user journey validation
- ✅ **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing results
- ✅ **Accessibility Tests**: WCAG compliance validation
- ✅ **API Contract Tests**: Backward compatibility verification

**Pre-Production Deployment Process:**
- **Backup Creation**: Current pre-prod state saved to S3
- **Helm Deployment**: Application deployed using standardized charts
- **Health Verification**: Kubernetes readiness and liveness probes
- **Smoke Testing**: Critical functionality validation
- **Performance Baseline**: Response time and throughput verification
- **Security Validation**: Runtime security checks
- **Feature Flag Testing**: Validate flag behavior in production-like environment

**Pre-Production Environment Requirements:**
- Production-like configuration and data
- Full integration with external systems
- Complete monitoring and observability
- Realistic load testing capabilities
- **Data masking** for sensitive information
- **Network topology** matching production
- **Security controls** equivalent to production

### Production Promotion

**Promotion Criteria:**
- ✅ Pre-production deployment successful
- ✅ All smoke tests passed
- ✅ Performance within acceptable thresholds
- ✅ Security scans clean
- ✅ Business stakeholder approval (for major features)
- ✅ **Monitoring dashboards configured**
- ✅ **Rollback plan validated**
- ✅ **On-call team notified**

**The production environment has two clusters:**
1. **Production**
2. **Canary**

**Deployment Flow with Database Migration Integration:**

**Pre-Deployment (if database changes required):**
1. **Database Migration Pipeline** executes first (separate from app deployment)
2. **Migration validation** ensures backward compatibility
3. **Database backup** created before migration
4. **Migration applied** to UAT → Canary → Production (in sequence)
5. **Compatibility testing** with existing application version

**Application Deployment Flow:**
1. Deployment is first pushed to **Canary cluster**
2. Feature flag is turned-on on **Canary**
3. Manual/Automated tests run targeting the Canary cluster (header-based/url-based with ALB)
4. **Database compatibility verified** (app can read/write to migrated schema)
6. **Continuous monitoring** 
7. If everything works as planned, deployment is pushed/promoted to **Production**
8. Feature flag is turned-on on **Production** (same gradual process)
9. Manual/Automated tests are run
10. **Business metrics validated** (including database performance)
11. **Stable version marked** in deployment metadata
12. If everything works as planned, deployment is marked as complete

## >> DATABASE MIGRATION STRATEGY: EXPAND-AND-CONTRACT PATTERN <<

### Database Change Philosophy
**DECOUPLE DATABASE AND APPLICATION DEPLOYMENTS**

All database changes must be **backward compatible** and deployed **before** application changes. This enables independent rollback of applications without database rollback.

### Three-Phase Migration Process

**Phase 1: EXPAND (Deploy database changes first)**
```sql
-- Example: Adding new column
ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
ALTER TABLE users ADD INDEX idx_email_verified (email_verified);

-- Example: Adding new table
CREATE TABLE user_preferences (
    user_id INT NOT NULL,
    preference_key VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    preference_value TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

**Phase 2: MIGRATE (Deploy application changes)**
- Application updated to use both old and new schema
- New code writes to both old and new columns/tables
- New code reads from new schema, falls back to old if needed
- Feature flags control which code path is active

**Phase 3: CONTRACT (Remove old schema - separate deployment)**
```sql
-- After all applications updated (weeks/months later)
ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN old_email_field;
DROP INDEX idx_old_email;
```

### Database Migration Pipeline

**Separate DB Migration Pipeline (runs before app deployment):**
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    parameters {
        string(name: 'MIGRATION_VERSION', description: 'Database migration version')
        choice(name: 'TARGET_ENV', choices: ['uat', 'canary', 'production'])
    }
    
    stages {
        stage("Validate-Migration") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Validate migration is backward compatible
                    validateMigrationCompatibility()
                    // Check for long-running operations
                    validateMigrationPerformance()
                    // Verify rollback script exists
                    validateRollbackScript()
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage("Backup-Database") {
            steps {
                script {
                    createDatabaseBackup(env.TARGET_ENV)
                    validateBackupIntegrity()
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage("Apply-Migration") {
            steps {
                script {
                    applyMigration(env.TARGET_ENV, params.MIGRATION_VERSION)
                    validateMigrationSuccess()
                    updateMigrationRegistry()
                }
            }
        }
        
        stage("Verify-Compatibility") {
            steps {
                script {
                    // Run existing application against new schema
                    runCompatibilityTests()
                    validateApplicationConnectivity()
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    post {
        failure {
            script {
                rollbackDatabaseMigration(env.TARGET_ENV)
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Migration Best Practices

**Backward Compatibility Rules:**
- ✅ **Adding columns**: Always with DEFAULT values
- ✅ **Adding tables**: No dependencies on existing data
- ✅ **Adding indexes**: Use ONLINE algorithm where possible
- ❌ **Dropping columns**: Only in CONTRACT phase
- ❌ **Renaming columns**: Use ADD + populate + DROP approach
- ❌ **Changing data types**: Use expand-and-contract pattern

**Migration Safety Checks:**
```yaml
migration_validations:
  performance:
    max_execution_time: "30 seconds"
    max_table_lock_time: "5 seconds"
    estimated_downtime: "0 seconds"
  
  compatibility:
    backward_compatible: true
    rollback_script_exists: true
    test_coverage: ">95%"
  
  data_integrity:
    foreign_key_constraints: "validated"
    data_validation_queries: "passing"
    referential_integrity: "maintained"
```

## >> ENHANCED ROLLBACK STRATEGY <<

### Rollback Decision Framework: Feature Flag vs Full Application Rollback

**Critical Decision Point:** When issues arise, determining whether to disable feature flags or perform a full application rollback can mean the difference between 10-second recovery and 2-minute downtime.

### When Feature Flag Disable is SUFFICIENT:

**Issue is Feature-Specific:**
- Error rate spikes only for new feature endpoints
- Business metrics affected only relate to the new feature
- Application core functionality remains stable
- Database queries/performance issues only on new code paths

**Clean Feature Isolation:**
- New feature code is well-separated from existing functionality
- Feature flags provide clean on/off switches
- No shared state contamination between old and new code paths
- Fallback mechanisms exist for feature failures

**Infrastructure Metrics Normal:**
- CPU, memory, network utilization within normal ranges
- Database connection pools stable
- Cache hit ratios unchanged
- Pod restart counts normal
- Application startup successful

**Backward Compatibility Maintained:**
- Database schema changes are additive only
- APIs remain backward compatible
- No breaking changes to shared services
- Configuration changes don't affect core functionality

### When Full Application Rollback is REQUIRED:

**Infrastructure-Level Issues:**
- CPU usage >90% or memory usage >85%
- Pod restart count >5 per minute
- Database connection pool exhausted
- Startup failures affecting multiple pods
- Network connectivity issues

**Cross-Feature Contamination:**
- Performance degradation affects all endpoints
- Memory leaks affecting entire application
- Database connection leaks impacting all queries
- Threading issues or deadlocks in shared code
- Security vulnerabilities in common libraries

**Breaking Changes:**
- Database migrations that break existing functionality
- API contract changes affecting other services
- Shared library updates causing compatibility issues
- Configuration changes affecting core application behavior

**Application Won't Start:**
- Container crashes on startup
- Kubernetes readiness/liveness probes failing consistently
- Service discovery issues preventing communication
- Critical dependency failures (databases, external services)

### Automated Decision Engine

**Health Check Analysis Engine:**
The pipeline automatically analyzes failure patterns to determine the appropriate rollback strategy:

**Error Pattern Analysis:**
- Compares total error rate vs feature-specific error rate
- If >80% of errors come from new feature endpoints → Feature flag disable
- If errors are distributed across all endpoints → Full rollback

**Infrastructure Health Assessment:**
- Monitors CPU, memory, network, and database metrics
- Checks pod stability and restart patterns
- Evaluates resource utilization trends
- Assesses application startup success rates

**Feature Isolation Validation:**
- Analyzes whether errors are contained within feature boundaries
- Checks for shared state corruption
- Validates fallback mechanism effectiveness
- Reviews database query impact scope

**Database Impact Assessment:**
- Evaluates whether database performance issues affect only new queries
- Monitors connection pool health and query performance
- Assesses transaction success rates across features
- Checks for schema-related compatibility issues

### Improved Rollback Process with Stable Version Tracking

**Pipeline Stable Version Management:**
Every successful production deployment automatically updates the stable version reference stored in Kubernetes ConfigMap and artifact repository. This ensures rollback targets are always current and tested.

### Automated Rollback Triggers

**Health Check Monitoring (Continuous during deployment and 10 minutes post-deployment):**
- **Application Health**: Service endpoint availability and response
- **Error Rate Threshold**: >1% error rate triggers automatic rollback
- **Response Time**: >2 second 95th percentile response time
- **Business Metrics**: Order completion rate, transaction volume drops >20%
- **Infrastructure**: CPU >80%, Memory >85%, Network saturation
- **Database**: Connection pool exhaustion, query timeout increases
- **Feature Flag Health**: FlagD service availability and response time

### Enhanced Multi-Level Rollback Options

**Level 1: Feature Flag Disable (5-10 seconds) - FIRST RESPONSE**
- **Immediate feature disabling** via FlagD service
- **Fastest recovery method** - disables problematic feature instantly
- **Zero downtime** - no application restart required
- **Granular control** - can disable specific features while keeping app running
- **Immediate effect** - FlagD propagates changes to all application instances

**Level 2: Stable Version Rollback (30-60 seconds) - CANARY FIRST**
- **Canary cluster rollback first** to validate rollback success
- **Production rollback** only after canary validation
- **Uses pre-tested stable version** stored in deployment metadata
- **Same deployment process** as forward deployments for consistency

**Level 3: Traffic Rerouting (10 seconds) - EMERGENCY BYPASS**
- **Emergency traffic redirection** to known stable pods
- **Service mesh or load balancer** configuration changes
- **Immediate customer impact mitigation** while other rollbacks proceed
- **Can be combined** with other rollback methods

**Level 4: Database State Validation (if applicable)**
- **For deployments that included database changes**
- **Verify database state** is compatible with stable application version
- **Database rollback procedures** if schema incompatibility detected
- **Coordination with database team** for complex scenarios

**Level 5: Complete Environment Restoration (2-5 minutes)**
- **Full environment restoration** from pre-deployment backup
- **Complete application state recovery** including configuration
- **Database restoration** if necessary (should be rare with expand-contract)
- **Last resort** before manual intervention

**Level 6: Manual Intervention**
- **On-call team notification** via PagerDuty
- **Escalation for complex issues** requiring human judgment
- **Complete incident response** process activation
- **Executive notification** for customer-impacting incidents

### Feature Design Guidelines for Better Rollback Decisions

**Code Structure for Clean Rollbacks:**

**Well-Isolated Features:**
- Clean separation between new and existing functionality
- Feature flags provide simple on/off switches without side effects
- Fallback mechanisms automatically engage when new features fail
- Shared state remains unmodified by new feature code

**Database Query Isolation:**
- New features use additive database changes only
- Existing queries remain unchanged and unaffected
- New columns have appropriate default values
- No modifications to existing data formats or constraints

**Error Handling Best Practices:**
- New feature errors don't propagate to existing functionality
- Graceful degradation when feature flags are disabled
- Comprehensive logging for feature-specific issues
- Circuit breaker patterns for external service calls

**Resource Management:**
- New features don't impact shared resource pools
- Separate connection pools or rate limits where appropriate
- Memory usage contained within feature boundaries
- CPU-intensive operations properly isolated

### Monitoring Dashboard for Rollback Decisions

**Real-time Decision Support Metrics:**

**Error Rate Analysis:**
- Error rate by endpoint to identify feature-specific issues
- Comparison of total vs feature-specific error rates
- Error pattern distribution across application components
- Historical baseline comparison for anomaly detection

**Infrastructure Health Indicators:**
- CPU and memory utilization per pod and namespace
- Pod restart frequency and failure patterns
- Database connection pool usage and query performance
- Network latency and throughput metrics

**Feature Impact Assessment:**
- Business metrics affected by feature activation
- User adoption rates and feature usage patterns
- Performance impact of feature flag changes
- Customer satisfaction correlation with feature rollouts

**Database Performance Monitoring:**
- Query execution time for new vs existing queries
- Connection pool utilization and wait times
- Transaction success rates by feature area
- Schema change impact on overall database performance

### Rollback Decision Automation

**Automated Analysis Triggers:**
The pipeline continuously monitors key metrics and automatically determines the appropriate rollback strategy based on failure patterns and system health indicators.

**Decision Criteria:**
- If errors are localized to new features AND infrastructure is healthy → Feature flag disable
- If infrastructure is degraded OR errors span multiple features → Full application rollback
- If database issues are detected → Coordinate with database rollback procedures
- If multiple rollback attempts fail → Escalate to manual intervention

### Rollback Decision Matrix

| Condition | Action | Timeline | Notification |
|-----------|--------|----------|--------------|
| Error rate >1% | Feature flag disable → Helm rollback | 10s → 30s | Teams, Slack |
| Response time >2s | Helm rollback | 30s | Teams, Slack |
| Health endpoint down | Traffic reroute → Backup restore | 10s → 5min | Teams, Slack, PagerDuty |
| Business metrics drop >20% | Manual review → Feature flag disable | 30s | Teams, Slack, PagerDuty |
| Database issues | Database rollback → App rollback | 2-10min | PagerDuty, On-call, Executive |
| Security incident | Immediate traffic block → Investigation | <10s | Security team, Executive |
